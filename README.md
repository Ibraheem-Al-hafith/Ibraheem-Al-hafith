## 🔭 What I'm learning now
- Computer Science fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, software engineering basics)  
- Statistical thinking and probability (inference, hypothesis testing, regression)  
- Python for data science (NumPy, pandas) and machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch)  
- Data wrangling, visualization, and exploratory data analysis  
- Basics of model evaluation, experiment design, and reproducibility

---

## 💡 Interests
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- Applied AI — using models to solve real-world problems (healthcare, education, environment, business)  
- Interpretable and responsible AI (making models understandable and fair)  
- Data-driven decision making

---

## 🎯 Goals
Short-term
- Complete hands-on projects that demonstrate end-to-end workflows: data → model → evaluation → simple deployment
- Build a small portfolio of practical, well-documented experiments

Mid / long-term
- Contribute AI solutions that address real problems (automation, prediction, decision support)
- Collaborate with others on interdisciplinary projects combining CS and statistics
